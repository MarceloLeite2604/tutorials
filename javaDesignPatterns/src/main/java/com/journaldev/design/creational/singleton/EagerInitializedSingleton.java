/**
 * If the singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the
 * recommended approach. But in most of the scenarios, singleton classes are
 * created for resources such as file system, database connections, etc. and we
 * should avoid the instantiation until client calls the getInstance method.
 * Also the eager singleton doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
 * To provide exception handling, the {@link StaticBlockSingleton} must be used.
