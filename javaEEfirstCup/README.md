<p>This directory contains the Eclipse projects created while following the <a href="http://doc.oracle.com/javaee/7/firstcup/intro.html">Your First Cup: An Introduction to the Java EE Platform</a> tutorial.
<p>Although this tutorial recommends Oracle Glassfish as server, I've decided to use Apachee TomEE, so minor modifications on the project were necessary to run it on this server.</p>
<p>Tutorial site: http://doc.oracle.com/javaee/7/firstcup/intro.html</p>
<p>This project was developed using Eclipse JavaEE Neon.1a Release (4.6.1) runing on JDK 1.8.0_144. The application server used was Apache TomEE PluME version 7.0.4 running on JRE 1.7.0_80.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="https://github.com/javaee/firstcup-examples">Java Enterprise Edition "firstcup-examples" Github repository</a> was analysed to comprehend the directory structure and file locations to generate the war files.</p>
