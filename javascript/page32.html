<h2>JavaScript String Methods</h2>

<p>The search() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var str = "Please locate where 'locate' occurs!";
// There is also a method called "indexOf" to search for specific texts. The difference between "search" and "indexOf" is that the former accepts regular expressions, and the latter accepts an initial position to start the search.
var pos = str.search("locate");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = pos;
</script>
