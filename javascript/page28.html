<p>A GLOBAL variable can be accessed from any script or function.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// This variable is global and can be accessed on any script location.
// In Javascript, the global scope is the complete Javascript environment, however, in HTML, the global scope means the window object.
var carName = "Volvo";
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
    // This variable is local and can only be accessed on this function. When local variables has the same name as a local, it also has priority on global value (but it does not overwrite the global variable content).
    var carName = "Volkswagen";

    // When an undeclared variable has its value assigned, it automatically becomes global.
    carType = "Golf";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        "I can display " + carName;
